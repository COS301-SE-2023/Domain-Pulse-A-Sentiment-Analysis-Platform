{"data": "The lack of communication from UP is disturbing. Students are not allowed back on campus to deal with any queries or receive any assistance. Nor can you get any feedback on multiple emails sent over several weeks either. And good luck trying to call someone for assistance, you have more chance of sliding uphill.  I am not sure how we are expected to deal with this? Surely if face to face communication is not permitted, one would expect them to be fully resourced electronically or telephonically to deal with this? My son's future career is at stake but I cannot get hold of anyone to help us. Very disappointed in an institution that I started out having so much faith in.
