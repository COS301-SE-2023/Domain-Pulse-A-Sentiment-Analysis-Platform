The step is to high for the older customers of Goddess Café and so the step is oftenly missed, causing customers to fall to the ground and get badly hurt. I hope the owner and management of the restaurant will take my review under advisement and solve the problem so the Goddess Café restaurant may be enjoyed by women of all ages.",
