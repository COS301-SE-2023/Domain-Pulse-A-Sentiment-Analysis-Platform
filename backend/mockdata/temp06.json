{"data": "It was my first time booking a table at Goddess cafe in Waterkloof and the place looks amazing, however the service was really terrible, the waiters and staff tried their best to make the place comfortable however the manager was very unprofessional. Upon booking they did not explain that you only allowed to dine for two hours at the restaurant and we found out the hard way when the manager Gorgia came to basically scold at us for having friends that were late in her establishment. This was so bizarre because we were paying for the whole table and I\u2019ve never heard of restaurants only allowing people a two hour dinning time if you had booked a table, more so even shocking that she failed to come tell us this in a professional manner instead of causing a scene, basically making inferences I assume to her white customers that she had to send away because we had open seats on the table we booked. If we were asked to leave because the table was missing people it would have probably been better than spoken to in a condescending and rude manner. Definitely would not recommend this branch.", "general": {"category": "VERY_NEGATIVE", "score": 0.0034}, "emotions": {"anger": 0.0238, "surprise": 0.7198, "fear": 0.2564}, "toxicity": {"level_of_toxic": "Non-toxic", "score": 0.0004}, "ratios": {"positive": 0.156, "neutral": 0.665, "negative": 0.179}, "source_id": 0}
