{"data": "Beautifully decorated restaurant ideal for the girly girl in you. Pink and flowers are everywhere.The atmosphere is relaxed and tranquil. What I like about this one in Rietondale is that it is spacious. Enjoy a comfortable outing with friends with a variety of 'scene settings' to take photo's. I had the Persian Love Spice cake that was really delicious but it contains quite a number of hard cardamom seeds which is a put-off. I suggest using cardamom powder instead. Overall a great experience.", "general": {"category": "VERY_POSITIVE", "score": 0.9998}, "emotions": {"surprise": 0.0034, "neutral": 0.0051, "joy": 0.9915}, "toxicity": {"level_of_toxic": "Non-toxic", "score": 0.0006}, "ratios": {"positive": 0.441, "neutral": 0.539, "negative": 0.02}, "source_id": 1}
