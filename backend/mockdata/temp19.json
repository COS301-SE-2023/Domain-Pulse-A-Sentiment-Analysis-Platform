{"data": "It\u2019s bigger than the Waterkloof one, more spacious and pink fully decorated. One thing I enjoyed was the cappuccino \ud83d\ude0d the cup was big enough to not want a refill. I ordered a croissant with eggs and my friend ordered salmon Benedict something. The dishes looked beautiful for the pictures but the salmon was actually not good. The waitress who was helping us was nice and friendly. I complained about parking but there\u2019s a space outside by the municipal park and there\u2019s a car guard. Overall experience was okay. I\u2019ll go back again just for the cappuccino.", "general": {"category": "VERY_POSITIVE", "score": 0.998}, "emotions": {"surprise": 0.029, "neutral": 0.0769, "joy": 0.8941}, "toxicity": {"level_of_toxic": "Non-toxic", "score": 0.0005}, "ratios": {"positive": 0.297, "neutral": 0.675, "negative": 0.029}, "source_id": 1}
