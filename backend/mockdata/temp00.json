{"data": "I like the decor and waiter was pleasant and friendly. Food was good, taste was good and temperature was just right. I\u2019ll give 9/10 for the food and presentation. I ordered caramel creamy coffee blue and white chocolate and coconut cake. Coffee was blue because bubblegum flavoring was added and it became bit too sweet and single shot of coffee didn\u2019t do much and I didn\u2019t taste caramel, cake was also just average and lacked sponge was not very smooth. I\u2019ll give 6/10. Overall it\u2019s a nice place and I\u2019ll definitely go again.", "general": {"category": "VERY_POSITIVE", "score": 0.9994}, "emotions": {"surprise": 0.0122, "neutral": 0.0474, "joy": 0.9404}, "toxicity": {"level_of_toxic": "Non-toxic", "score": 0.0004}, "ratios": {"positive": 0.267, "neutral": 0.733, "negative": 0.0}, "source_id": 0}
