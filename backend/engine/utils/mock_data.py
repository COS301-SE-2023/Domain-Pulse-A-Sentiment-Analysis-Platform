    "Lived up to the expectations. Grab and run... pleasant and fast service. Definitely a must visit again",

    "Starbucks is good because there is always good coffee, there is Wi-Fi Internet and your name will be loudly called here once. It is right if it is simple and wrong if it is unusual. All of the above is in this Starbucks, which is conveniently located at a significant intersection in Rosebank.",
   
    "I just got looked at when I was at the wrong side of the line (not clear where the right side is) Could not spell my name correctly even though I spelt it out 3 times.",
    
    "Everything is amazing about Starbucks The service is just so good The drinks are the absolute best Keep coming back ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èüëç",
    
    "Just bad choice of blend. Poorly made. Really bad texture of frothed milk. Very hyped. Seattle Coffee Co. still the best.",
   
    "If I could live here, I would. i love Starbucks on Rosebank that much. The best blueberry muffins I have ever tasted. Great coffee as well :-)",
   
    "Coffee is always Good , but unfortunately the food is not up to Starbucks quality Like overseas , the food is premade and delivered , so if you eat a toasted cheese it just get heated up in the microwave",
    
    "We have just moved into Melrose and this Starbucks is our local coffee bar. You can get tickets (if resident) so that everytime you buy a coffee you get the fifth one free. Great staff that get to know your name and what you are drinking."

    "Frank Murphy is a disgrace. How can a man who used to play for Munster be allowed to ref this",
    
    "Gutted",
    
    "Another loss at the knock out stages. You Leinster coaching just not listening. Keep playing 2nd choice teams and keep getting knocked out. Will lose in the HC AS as well",
    
    "Embarrassing and disrespectful to the URC by Leinster. Shouldn‚Äôt be allowed shelve half the squad for a semi final absolute joke.?",
    
    "Check all these Leinster fans ‚Äúc team‚Äù ‚Äúsecond team‚Äù why full of excusesüíÄ",
   
    "Who decided to put a cork man in as ref in a Munster and Leinster semi 11-5 was the tally of penalties given Leinster made a mistake in over looking Munster to rest a few internationals before larochelle come to town",
   
    "This is where complacency gets us! Not fielding a full strength team in a semi final. Ffs!",
    
    "They are cheats munster",
    
    "I'm a Leinster fan but today was Munster's day, a well deserved win for them, brilliant match, full of excitement."

# A couple reviews about The Witcher 3 pulled from Reddit
the_witcher_reviews_reddit = [
"These distractions stand out in part because The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is otherwise incredible and sumptuous; the little quirks are pronounced when they are surrounded by stellar details. And make no mistake: this is one of the best role-playing games ever crafted, a titan among giants and the standard-setter for all such games going forward. Where the Witcher 2 sputtered to a halt, The Witcher 3 is always in a crescendo, crafting battle scenarios that constantly one-up the last, until you reach the explosive finale and recover in the glow of the game's quiet denouement. But while the grand clashes are captivating, it is the moments between conflicts, when you drink with the local clans and bask in a trobairitz's song, that are truly inspiring.",
"The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt encompasses what I hope is the future of RPGs. It stands out for its wonderful writing, variety of quests and things to do in the world, and how your choices have impact in interesting ways. Usually something is sacrificed when creating a world this ambitious, but everything felt right on cue. I still think about some of my choices and how intriguing they turned out - for better or worse.",
"Ambiguity and the messiness of human life. Games have already proven that they can build and populate open worlds, even worlds as majestic and romantic and wild as this one. But this stuff is a reminder that the Witcher 3 is trying to do something different. It is trying to make an open world feel convincingly inhabited, to give it the warp and weft of narrative history. That's a pretty interesting quest, and CD Projekt is a pretty interesting adventurer, beating a path into strange and bewitching new places. The result is that this Polish studio's first open world is one of the greatest we've ever seen.",
"Though the straightforward and fetch-quest-heavy main story overstays its welcome, the option of joyfully adventuring through a rich, expansive open world was always there for me when I‚Äôd start to burn out. Even if the plot isn‚Äôt terribly interesting, the many characters who play a part in it are, and along with the excellent combat and RPG gameplay, they elevate The Witcher 3 to a plane few other RPGs inhabit.",
"This are really great review scores. Even some of the negative things people talk about are positives for me. I read a review saying they were disappointed it wasn't a pure open world sandbox like skyrim and that you could easily walk into very difficult high level content. That sounds awesome to me! An open world with more focused direction and challenge is exactly what I want. Technical issues are a bummer but hopefully stuff like framerate wont be an issue on PC.",
"Are there any extremely critical reviews of the game? I feel like you always learn a lot more about what the experience is going to be like when you hear from someone who wasn't the biggest fan."

# Some data gathered from reddit about Lance Stroll
lance_reddit_data = [
    "In short, yes he got into F1 through his dad‚Äôs money.He‚Äôs also a decent midfield level talent who deserves his seat, even if he makes some really stupid/clumsy mistakes at times.He‚Äôs nowhere close to being the level of second-hand embarrassment pay drivers we‚Äôve seen through the decades.Personality, seems nice enough if somewhat introverted. Seems to have no great love of talking to the media but given the shit they‚Äôve given him over the years, can‚Äôt really blame him there.",
    """
    He's a decent driver, his dad is a billionaire who bought his seat, then he bought a team when it lost its funding.

Then turned it into Aston Martin.

Lance has never had much of a personality, and he's made a few mistakes (who hasn't), but he overall seems like a decent guy and a decent driver.

Just remember, if you're decent in F1, it means you're one of the top drivers in the world.

He absolutely received opportunities others wouldn't, but he's definitely made the most of them in F1 and hasn't sat on his yacht sipping champagne with a bunch of supermodels, which he absolutely could have done.""",
"Did money get him to F1? Undoubtedly? Does money or connections get MOST drivers into F1? Absolutely yes. I think Daniel Ricciardo said it best- money got him onto the grid, but his talent shows that he deserves to be there. I think that his introversion and awkwardness sometimes further the negative stereotypes, unfortunately.",
"He‚Äôs a talented driver - got a podium in his rookie season with Williams and is usually there or there about with his teammate (we‚Äôll see how he gets on against Alonso) - he is definitely on the grid and in his seat because of his Dad, but he has also proved time and time again he deserves to be there"
