        "As a joburger, I‚Äôm so jealous that this Goddess cafe is so much better , definitely worth the drive. Amazing waiters and I had the best quiche ever! The ladies certainly felt like Goddesses! How cool are the hats that my niece made!?üòç she couldn‚Äôt stop bragging to her friends about her experience.",
        "A beautiful Mother's Day Treat. Just loved every moment of our visit to Goddess Cafe Waterkloof from the friendly welcome, the pink water, amazing waitress, a very helpful manager, delicious drinks, tasty food experience. So worth it. Thank you for making it a great Mother's Day",
        "The staff is lovely, great customer service. The place is super cute and the food is great. Their cakes are some of the best I've had!",

        "Goddess Caf√©, a beautiful restaurant with excellent service. Only problem with the restaurant is the step you wil be needing to take to enter the restaurant area. The step is to high for the older customers of Goddess Caf√© and so the step is oftenly missed, causing customers to fall to the ground and get badly hurt. I hope the owner and management of the restaurant will take my review under advisement and solve the problem so the Goddess Caf√© restaurant may be enjoyed by women of all ages.",
        "Love the concept but, coffee was not great at all and it was cold, waffle was terrible, muffin was so dry, our breakfasts were not as expected and to be honest we won't be back.",
        "What a beautiful place. Service was a bit slow but the place was very busy, also waited quiet a while for the bill to come. It is however pricey and the portions are very small however very tasty.",

        "Sharks promised us a team that will fight and we got that. Problem is they were fighting against themselves. Pumas only had to work for 12 of their points tonight, a whopping 14 were just given to them by unforced errors. I don't know if the constant kicking was a gameplan or just unimaginative play but it wasn't working. You could see it flop the whole 2nd half and there was just no innovation. Einstein once said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.",
        "I'm still incredibly proud of this team. No matter what we saw fight that we hadn't seen before. Something here is being built. With you Sharks no matter the win or loss.",

        "A great university, with world-class facilities, equipment and lecturers. A majority of its course material is sourced from industry leading sources overseas and courses are benchmarked against similar offerings by universities world-wide. My course was extensive, all-inclusive, with ties to industry which provided me the opportunity to get practical, real world experience.",
        "I've studied here, and from what I've seen at other universities, UP campus is hugely under-appreciated. Awesome place to learn and meet up with other students.",
        "Not sure hows the university itself, however they do races sometimes. Like the Bestmed Tuks race. Absolute pathetic service to register for the race at tuks. No one knows about it and no one knows where you can get it. Staff very rude and extremely unhelpfull!",
        "Best university in South Africa by far. Their grounds are always clean, and their facilities are top class",
