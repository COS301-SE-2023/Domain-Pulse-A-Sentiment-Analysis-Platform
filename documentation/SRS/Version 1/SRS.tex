Introducing Domain Pulse, the ultimate sentiment analysis platform. With Domain Pulse, you can easily gauge the sentiment surrounding any domain. Whether it's a business, a person, or anything else, Domain Pulse gathers information from across the internet and analyzes what people are saying.\\
\\Domain Pulse presents the results in a visually stunning and easy-to-understand format. Our wide range of visualizations brings statistics to life, making it a breeze to grasp the online presence and sentiment for any domain. Take control of understanding public opinion like never before with Domain Pulse.
\subsection{Objectives}

The objectives of the Domain Pulse project are to develop a comprehensive web application that enables users to track and analyze data from multiple sources, perform sentiment analysis, and visualize statistics. The application aims to provide a user-centered design approach, ensuring usability, accessibility, and a clear and intuitive interface. The system will be built using a scalable and modifiable architecture, leveraging microservices to handle high traffic and enable easy modification and extension. Security will be a top priority, with encryption and access control measures in place to protect user data. The project also aims to achieve high performance through caching and database optimization techniques. Overall, the objective is to create a reliable and efficient platform that empowers users to gain valuable insights from data analysis.

Below we discuss which architectural patterns and tactics we will use to meet the quality requirements. The patterns and tactics are in bold.

\subsubsection*{Security}

\subsubsection*{Usability}

\begin{itemize}
  \item User-Centred Design Approach
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Consider the end-user throughout the design process and design the system accordingly.
          \item Make the terminology easy to understand but still meaningful, considering users with no technical knowledge about NLP (Natural Language Processing).
          \item Examples of end-users: R\&D specialists, social media managers, project leaders, executives, consultants.
        \end{itemize}
  \item Clear and Intuitive Interface
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Reduce clutter on the dashboard.
          \item Ensure that the meaning and purpose of actions is clear through the use of descriptive and minimalistic icons.
          \item Provide user feedback as they navigate through the application.
          \item Utilize a user workflow of top-to-bottom, left-to-right navigation, ensuring that the process of completing steps feels natural and ordered.
        \end{itemize}
  \item Usability Testing
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Test the system with representative users.
          \item Collect and implement feedback.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Accessibility}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Implement a Dark Mode
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Cater to visually impaired and cognitive disabilities by providing a simple, distraction-free, high contrast user interface.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Scalability}

\subsubsection*{Availability}

\subsubsection*{Modifiability}

\subsubsection*{Performance}
