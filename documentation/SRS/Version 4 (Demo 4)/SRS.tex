\section{Class Diagram}

\includegraphics[width=13cm]{../../Images/classDiagram2.jpg}\\\\
\textbf{Design Patterns:} While the nature of the architecture does not lend itself to the Object-Oriented paradigm, two design patterns have been identified (and noted within the class diagram) - namely:\\\\
\textbf{Facade:} The \textit{QueryEngine} effectively acts as a \textit{Facade} to the \textit{SourceConnector}, the \textit{Analysis Engine}, and conceptually, to the database. This ensures that the \textit{QueryEngine} acts as a uniform interface to the frontend web-app (as well as the rest of the application in general) for the retrieval of data. That is, the rest of the system need not interact with the complicated underlying systems, but rather can communicate uniformly with the \textit{QueryEngine} (which abstracts out the complicated query logic involved with retrieving data from the database, from external APIs, or sending data for sentiment analysis in the \textit{AnalysisEngine}).\\\\
\textbf{Template Method:} Conceptually, the \textit{Template Method} design pattern is applied as follows: When a user defines a source, the source is categorized based on its type (e.g., Facebook, Reddit, etc). Each of these types of sources has different APIs with different parameters (and thus have different query strings). While the parent \textit{Source} class specifies the operation to build a query string, the individual, specific type of source defines exactly how that string may be built. i.e., The \textit{Source} is effectively a template for the construction of external API query strings, while the derivatives of the \textit{Source} (e.g., Reddit, Facebook, etc.) define how that template is "filled in" to construct the query string.

\section{Constraints}

\textbf{Technical Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We are required to make use of a NoSQL document-based database in our application (upon specification from Southern Cross Solutions), however, upon request and their advice (given our architecture), it is acceptable to use a SQL database for microservices where we deem it necessary.
  \item All technology used for development must be free and open source (upon specification from Southern Cross Solutions).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Performance Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
  \item There are no specific, measurable metrics of performance that the application is required to conform to; however, the following guidelines must be adhered to:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item The user must not wait for an inordinate amount of time for the data to be refreshed, including fetching new data from external APIs and performing analysis on that data.
          \item Viewing metrics for different sources and domains should feel seamless, with minimal waiting time involved in fetching the data.
          \item The web app needs to feel user-friendly, easy-to-use, and responsive.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Security Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
  \item User credentials must be stored with utmost care, ensuring that sensitive user information cannot be leaked and that another user may not gain unauthorized access to a user's account.
  \item The SSH keys provided to the team by Southern Cross Solutions cannot, under any circumstance, be leaked publicly and must only be sent across a secure platform.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Regulatory Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Need to conform to the Terms of Service as specified by each external API we make use of.
  \item Need to ensure compliance with POPIA if we were to associate content with the person who posted it.
  \item Need to adhere to Southern Cross Solutions' company policy regarding keeping SSH keys to virtual machines secure.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Cost Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
  \item No budget allocated for the project as of yet.
  \item Potentially a \$50 credit to make use of AWS services.
  \item Southern Cross Solutions have not confirmed whether they will supply a budget to make use of paid external APIs (such as that for Twitter) - this is an issue that will be addressed further along in development.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Time Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Need to have the final product delivered before the final demonstration and Project Day (approximately 6 months).
  \item Need to conform to milestone deadlines as set out by the requirements for demos 1 to 4.
\end{itemize}

\section{Technology Requirements}

\subsection{Development Environment}
For development, our team members shall be developing within VS Code on Linux to ensure consistency within the produced code and testing of our software. Having all members using VS Code also allows for the use of software such as Live Share for collaborative development to improve efficiency within development.

\subsection{Version Control}
Git will be used for version control, using a clear and simple branching strategy that allows members to easily work on distinct components of our system while also allowing the reverting to previous versions as a 'fail-safe'. Meanwhile, GitHub will be used to host the Git repository.

\subsection{Programming Languages}
Within our team, many (if not all) members have a high proficiency in coding in Python. Python is considered one of the best programming languages for Machine Learning and data analysis, which are aspects on which our system will heavily rely. Therefore, Python is our programming language of choice.

\subsection{Frameworks and Libraries}
We have decided to use Django as our web framework for the creation of our app due to its simplicity, efficiency, and secure data transmission capabilities. Within our Django project, we will be utilizing Python's proficiency in data analysis and machine learning by using the powerful Vader and Grafana libraries, which allow us to perform sentiment analysis on text and visualize our data, respectively. For the front-end development, we will be using Angular due to its versatility and ability to create high-quality user interfaces.

\subsection{Database Systems}
For our database systems, we will be using MongoDB as a document-based NoSQL database for data collection of comments, posts, and other content related to user data. Additionally, PostgreSQL will be used as an SQL database for storing user profiles and authentication data for ease of access and querying.

\subsection{Testing and Quality Assurance Tools}
We will perform various forms of testing to ensure the quality of our software. For front-end testing, Cypress will be used, and for unit testing, we will utilize the built-in Unittest library of Python, which is recommended for Django.

\subsection{Deployment and Infrastructure}
For deployment, our clients have provided a Linux-based virtual machine where we can deploy our software. We will use one virtual machine for the testing environment and another for the production environment to ensure a separation of concerns. Additionally, a domain may be acquired for ease of customer access to the software.

\subsection{Collaboration and Communication Tools}
To ensure effective communication within our team, we have a private WhatsApp group for important announcements, a private Discord server for more specific announcements and discussions, and a GitHub Project Board to track work progress. For communication with our clients, we have set up a Slack workspace for quick communication.

\subsection{Security and Encryption}
Our system is secured using technologies such as Django's authentication system, which encrypts user data. We prioritize the use of POST over GET for more secure data transmission. Our virtual machine is protected by extensive firewalls to prevent foreign attacks, and access is restricted to authorized members of our team using SSH and private login details.

\subsection{Continuous Integration and Deployment Tools}
We will utilize CI/CD technologies such as Codecov and GitHub Actions to ensure thorough testing and checking before deployment. GitHub Actions will automate the building, testing, and deployment processes, while Codecov will provide insights into test results and failures. We have been provided with separate production and testing environments to deploy and check the application's functionality.
