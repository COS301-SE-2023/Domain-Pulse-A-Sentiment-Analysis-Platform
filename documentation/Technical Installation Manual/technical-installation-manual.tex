\section{Introduction}
The following is a Technical Installation Manual for COS301 capstone project, Domain Pulse - A Sentiment Analysis Platform. Domain Pulse is
a system designed to fetch, analyse, aggregate, and present results of sentiment analysis on publically available data pertaining to
businesses, products, places, and more! Sources of data include (but are not limited to) Google reviews, TripAdvisor and Youtube.

This installation guide details how to setup and install the system locally. The system uses a Django backend (consisting of 5 independently deployable projects),
an Angular frontend as well as PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases. The installation of these components and the packages used within in
them, shall be explained within this manual.

Please note that the production application is a web application that is deployed to a private virtual machine acting as a web server. For
security purposes, this guide will not provide details or keys for connecting to the deployment server - instead this details local installation
of the application.

\subsection{Overview of installation process}
The process of installing the application consists of the following stages, each of which is to be described in detail later in the manual:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Installation and acquisition of prerequisites
    \item Downloading and configuring application
    \item Installing project specific dependencies
    \item Running the application
\end{itemize}

\section{Prerequisites - General Software}
The following software are prerequisites for the complete installation and set-up of Domain Pulse: Python 3.8, Pipenv (any 2022 or post 2022 version), Node.js (v18 later), Angular (v14), MongoDB (Community Edition, v6 or later), PostgreSQL 12.
Of course an operating system of either Linux (Ubuntu) or Windows is required, as well as a modern web browser.

Note: The installation of the project specific dependencies and packages is detailed later in the manual.

\subsection{Operating System}
The system may be installed locally on either a Windows or Linux (Ubuntu) operating system. The following versions are most suitable
\begin{itemize}
    \item Linux (Ubuntu): v22 or later
    \item Windows: v10 or later
\end{itemize}
Note that earlier or different versions of these operating systems may successfully install and run the application, however the provided
versions are deemed to be most suitable and confirmed to work.

\subsection{Web Browser}
Any modern web browser should support the appropriate rendering of the application. The following browsers have been confirmed as suitable:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Google Chrome - Latest version
    \item Mozilla Firefox - Latest version
    \item Brave - Latest version
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Python 3.8}
\subsubsection{Linux}
The following resources commnds be used for installing Python 3.8 on Linux:\\
sudo apt-get update\\
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa -y\\
sudo apt-get update\\
sudo apt install python3.8\\ \\
Ensure that the correct version of python is installed by running the following command:
python --version

\subsubsection{Windows}
The following resources may be used for installing Python 3.8 on Windows:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/

\subsection{Pipenv (any 2022 or post 2022 version)}
Once Python is installed, pip will be installed along with in. To install pipenv, enter into the terminal:\\
pip install pipenv

\subsection{Node.js v18 or later}
Node.js is needed for the installation and use of Angular and can be installed
following the instructions on the following resource:\\
https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs/

\subsection{Angular v14}
Once Node.js is installed, Angular can be installed by entering the following command into the terminal:\\
npm install -g @angular/cli

\subsection{MongoDB (Community Edition v6 or later)}
The following resources may be used for installing MongoDB
\begin{itemize}
    \item Windows: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/
    \item Ubuntu: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/
    \item MacOS: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/
\end{itemize}

\subsection{PostgreSQL 12}
The following resource can be used for installing PostgreSQL 12
\begin{itemize}
    \item https://www.postgresql.org/download/
\end{itemize}
Important note: Ensure that, regardless of what installer is used, PostgreSQL 12 specifically is installed.


\section{Prerequisites - Hardware}
The following are the minimum recommended specifications required to install and run Domain Pulse locally
\begin{itemize}
    \item CPU: Intel i5 11th Gen or Ryzen equivalent recommended
    \item RAM: 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended
    \item Storage: At least 20GB free space recommended (but database size dependent on use of application)
\end{itemize}


\section{Installation}

\subsection{Cloning the repo}
The repo may be cloned locally from Github using the following command: git clone https://github.com/COS301-SE-2023/Domain-Pulse-A-Sentiment-Analysis-Platform.git

\subsection{Installing dependencies}
\subsubsection{Backend}
In terminal, navigate to the 'backend' directory. To install all necessary dependencies at the appropriate versions, issue the following
command: pipenv install. This will install all the necessary dependencies into a local virtual environment.

Note: Some of the dependencies are fairly sizable. Depending on Internet speeds, this process may take a few minutes.

The full list of dependencies that will be installed can be found in the the file backend/Pipfile. Furthemore, to see the specific versions you may issue the CLI command 'pipenv graph'. The dependencies are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item coverage==7.2.6
    \item django-cors-headers==4.2.0
    \item djangorestframework-simplejwt==5.2.2
    \item mock==5.1.0
    \item nltk==3.8.1
    \item psycopg2-binary==2.9.6
    \item pymongo==4.4.0
    \item python-dotenv==1.0.0
    \item transformers==4.30.2
    \item vaderSentiment==3.3.2
\end{itemize}
Note that each dependencies may have its own sub-dependencies. These too will be installed via 'pipenv install'.

\subsubsection{Frontend}


Installation - this describes how the installation of your system would work

My understanding is this would be like actually getting the code onto your machine and how to install the prerequisites once you have the code
Luckily we've got stuff like pipenv install to just get all the python packages


\section{Deployment and Running}
Deployment/Running - detail how your system should be executed and provide the link to your user
manual on how the system should be used

Ideally we can write a script thta just goes and runs the frontend and backend so we don't need to write down the actual details or commands
