\section{Introduction}
The following is a technical installation manual for the project Domain Pulse, a system designed to aggregate and
process data for given domains (businesses, products, etcâ€¦),
over given sources (Google reviews, TripAdvisor and others) and provide the user,
peoples sentiment towards their domain. The system uses a Django backend, Angular frontend and PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases.
The installation of these components and the packages used within in them, shall be explained within this manual.

\subsection{Some subsection}
If we need to add more details or break it up

\section{Prerequisites}
Prerequisites - any necessary software or packages that are needed for your system to work. You
should list the requirements first. After that, specify a resource or provide instructions on how to
install the prerequisites.

Here we need to list all the software we need to install (including pipenv and npm packages). We can put links to how to install say MongoDB or Postgres.

\section{Installation}
Installation - this describes how the installation of your system would work

My understanding is this would be like actually getting the code onto your machine and how to install the prerequisites once you have the code
Luckily we've got stuff like pipenv install to just get all the python packages


\section{Deployment and Running}
Deployment/Running - detail how your system should be executed and provide the link to your user
manual on how the system should be used

Ideally we can write a script thta just goes and runs the frontend and backend so we don't need to write down the actual details or commands
